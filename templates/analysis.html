      <p>The sentiment analysis of r/doge Reddit thread comments was processed and performed using VADER, a sentiment analysis tool attuned to social media. The extraction of comments for sentiment polarity comparison to stock price movement was performed using the total 
        comments of each daily discussion thread of the r/doge subReddit within the relative time period to determine congruency with the cryptocurrency stock price for the duration of 3 months at 30-minute intervals. Extraction of the comments from each daily discussion 
        thread was made using PRAW (Reddit API) for thread id extraction, and PMAW, a 3rd-party wrapper for pushshift.io that supports multi-threading and batch requests for comment extraction of each thread ID. A total of 554K comments were ran through VADER, a model 
        trained on NYT OPEds, IMDB Reviews, Amazon Reviews, and Twitter Feeds. From there each comment was attributed with a Polarity/Compound Score which was determined to be of an overall positive, 
        negative or neutral sentiment based on its -1 to 1 value being above 0.05 rated as Positive, below -0.05 rated as Negative, and between -0.05 and 0.05 rated as Neutral, for an overall comment score.

      <h5>Naive Bayes Text Classifier and Prediction Accuracy based on VADER Sentiment Analysis Categorization</h5>
      <p>Based on the VADER categoration of each comment score, the dataset of comments as well as it's attributed score was then input into an ML pipeline to label and determine features. A Naive Bayes model was then created to fit the training
      data and predict a sentiment of Positive, Negative or Neutral for each comment in the testing data. The model predicted reviews with an overall 77% accuracy. </p>

        <br>
      <h5>Random Forests Text Classifier and Prediction Accuracy based on VADER Sentiment Analysis Categorization</h5>
      The same data was taken and processed for comment features and vectorized to fit a TFIDF feature matrix. The data was then split for training and testing and ran through Random Forest Classifier. 
      The results of the RFC predictions were then determined in a classification report and the model predicted reviews with an overall 86% accuracy.

      <br><br>
      <h6>Precision = of all the positive predicted, what percentage is truly positive.</h6>
      <p>Negative Precision: Of all comments predicted to be Negative by the RF classifier, 78% were truly Negative.</p>
      <p>Neutral Precision: Of all comments predicted to be Neutral by the RF classifier, 87% were truly Neutral.</p>
      <p>Positive Precision: Of all comments predicted to be Positive by the RF classifier, 87% were truly Positive. </p>
<br>
      <h6>Recall = of the total positive, what percentage are predicted positive. TPR (true positive rate)</h6>
      <p>Negative Recall: Of the total Negative comments, the RF classifier predicted 63% correctly.</p>
      <p>Neutral Recall: Of the total Neutral comments, the RF classifier predicted 96% correctly.</p>
      <p>Positive Recall: Of the total Positive comments, the RF classifier predicted 86% correctly.</p>
<br>
      <h6>F1 = weighted average of Precision and Recall. It takes both the False Positives and False Negatives into account.</h6>
      <p>Negative F1: The RF classifier was 70% accurate in identifying Negative comments correctly. </p>
      <p>Neutral F1: The RF classifier was 91% accurate in identifying Neutral comments correctly.</p>
      <p>Positive F1: The RF classifier was 86% accurate in identifying Positive comments correctly.</p>
